This is an about me page.

I was born and raised in Virginia on the east coast about a 15 minute bike ride from the beach. After playing on nationally ranked baseball teams and being the President of my high school, I got into and graduated from the University of Virginia with a Bachelors of Arts in Psychology and a minor in Astronomy. I currently teach English at a University in South Korea. I expect to finish my Masters in Liberal Arts with a concentration in digital media arts and instructional design from Harvard Extension in 2017. I’m married to my best friend and together we’re raising the happiest little boy in the world.

Travel – After graduation, I stumbled into a job teaching English in South Korea. I took advantage of that opportunity and became somewhat of a world traveler. Here are some of the things I’ve done:

Climbed the Great Wall in China

Hiked to the top of Mt. Fuji in Japan (in a typhoon like an idiot)

Surfed in 5 different countries including Bali and Costa Rica

Drove New Zealand from top to bottom

Drove cross country in the US x 3

Lived a mile from the Pacific Ocean in So Cal

Volunteered as a plumber in Peru

Hiked the Salkantay Trail to Machu Pichuu

Drank Guinness in Dublin, Ireland

Sky-dived with my mom

Rode a camel in Mongolia

Rock-climbed in Ha Long Bay, Vietnam

Angkor Watt at sunrise

Andaman Sea at sunset

Saw the brightest constellations in the darkest night sky you can imagine

I consider the life I’ve lived to be lucky and 100 times more adventurous than I ever imagined. Most importantly, I’m grateful to have loving, supportive, and inspiring friends and family by my side along the way.
